Air Q

## Update: I changed completly over to esphome. Using this custom component here: https://github.com/tom1422/ESPHome-HPMA115S0-Sensor-Component

This is a project I have been using for a while to read from a pm2.5/pm10 sensor and publish to mqtt.

I am about to change everything, and I'm not sure how, so I am committing this first.

User beware.
